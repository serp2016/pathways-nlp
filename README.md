# Intelligence Information Extraction System for Clinical Orientation(IIES)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a process to make computer understand human language input and get output base on human understanding requirements.  In the clinical healthcare today, clinical experts have to find the questions, answers and conditions from tons of clinical guidelines, and use these information to create clinical pathways.  The Intelligent Information Extraction System (IIES) is designed to help clinical experts resolve the difficulties to find useful information from clinical guidelines.  The research has been done based on the comparison between the existing Natural Language Processing Toolkits.  The preliminary results of the research show that stanford CoreNLP suite is the richest NLP tool to implementing IIES, and the distributed database benefits the quick processing.  Latest version of the system is able to identifying nearly all the domain questions, and the majority of identified questions are provided after the processing.  According to experience of users, IIES was useful and obtained acceptance in target condition.
